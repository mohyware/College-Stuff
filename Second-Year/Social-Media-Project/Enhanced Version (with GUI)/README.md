The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage users, browse users, and display user activity statistics. It allows for a more intuitive and visually appealing interaction compared to CLI applications.

## Features

1. **User Management**: Add, delete, and modify users from the system.
2. **User Browsing**: View the list of users with simple navigation.
3. **User Activity Statistics**: Display detailed statistics on user activity.
4. **Interactive Menu**: Navigate through the system via an intuitive console-based menu system with keyboard inputs.

## Data Structures

The project uses multiple data structures to efficiently handle its core functionalities:

- **Vectors**: 
  Used to hold a dynamic list of menu options.

- **Maps and Unordered Maps**: 
  For efficient lookup and storage of user-related data.

- **Queues and Stacks**: 
  To manage temporary storage and retrieval during browsing and statistics operations.

- **Pairs and Sets**: 
  For unique collections and paired data storage, enabling quick operations on unique users.

- **Custom Y-Combinator Function Template**:
  This template enables recursion in lambda functions to make certain operations cleaner.
